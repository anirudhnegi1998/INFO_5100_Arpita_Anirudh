# We Are ONE


## About Us:

2% of Meta’s revenue, approx 1.2 billion dollars was donated in 2020. 
Bill Gates has already donated 50 billion dollars since 1994. A lot of other 
unknown personalities and organizations are regularly contributing.   

Ever wonder where does this money go? How many people in need were treated
and brought home safely? 

We Are One strives to address this issue in the best 
way possible. WAO organizes events to raise funds 
for those who cannot afford health cards. The catch is, at the niche level, when we use WAO, 
we would know exactly how much money is required for a patient treatment following which we
will request money from the sponsor. So, the sponsor would know who is being treated with
his/her money. So, it’s patient first - money later process. This would create a transparent
system and will improve the current donation system.
